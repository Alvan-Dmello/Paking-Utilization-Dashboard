# Parking Utilization Analysis Dashboard

This project delivers a **high-performance Power BI dashboard** built for operational analysis of parking trends and utilization across a network of over **30 parking lots**. The solution utilizes advanced data modeling techniques to efficiently process 
and visualize over **4 million transaction records**.

## üí° Key Features & Technical Execution

The dashboard showcases expertise in the entire BI workflow, from ETL scripting to final visualization:

* **Massive Data Handling:** Successfully modeled and transformed **4 million timestamped transaction records** using optimized Power Query steps, ensuring rapid load times.
* **Advanced DAX Logic:** Utilized **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) to create complex calculated KPIs, measure utilization rates, and dynamically generate custom visual labels, improving data readability and reporting speed.
* **Time-Based Filtering:** Integrated **Chiclet Slicers** for intuitive and seamless filtering of utilization data by specific time periods (e.g., peak hours, weekends, or specific days of the week).
* **Operational Analysis:** Provides clear visualizations of occupancy and turnover rates, enabling quick identification of peak demand and underutilized lots for strategic pricing decisions.
